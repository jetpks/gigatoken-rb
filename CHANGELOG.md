# Changelog

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-24

- Remove a hidden memcpy in the core's `Committer::finish`: under mimalloc
  (this gem's global allocator), `shrink_to_fit` on the multi-GB gathered
  token buffer copies instead of trimming in place. The unpacked
  `encode_batch` path gains roughly half a second per pass at 11.9 GB; the
  packed path was never affected. One-line fix, submitted upstream as
  [marcelroed/gigatoken#38](https://github.com/marcelroed/gigatoken/issues/38).
- README and benchmark docs carry the measured post-fix numbers: 12,449 MB/s
  median on the 11.9 GB OpenWebText corpus, parity with the fixed Python
  wheel within 2%.
- Sync with upstream main.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-23

- Initial release: Ruby bindings for the gigatoken engine. BPE and
  SentencePiece tokenization, `tokenizer.json` / HuggingFace Hub /
  `.tiktoken` loading, native-side file tokenization (`encode_files`,
  `.gz`/`.zst` transparent), packed `IO::Buffer` results, GVL-releasing
  fiber-friendly encodes, `bench`/`validate` CLI, precompiled native gems
  for arm64-darwin / x86_64-linux / aarch64-linux.
